# Calculator

## Analysis

Have a look at the windows calculator and breakdown the different components and what they do. Write this down and make sure to give all of the components a proper functional name. Also group functionalities that are similar like numbers, memory handling, mathematical functions, ...

## User Interface

Build a user interface with these components that you have described before. Make sure that basic functionaliteis work like displaying text, registering button presses. Don't add any logic at this point. Just ui functionality.

## logic

Make a design on how you look at a calculator from an object oriented point of view. (if we havent't covered this at this point make sure to send me a reminder as we need to be able to express ourselvesd with out having to write code all thet time. That would be boring wouldn't it)
