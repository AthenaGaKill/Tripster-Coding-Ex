# Good reads to keep oneself busy

After you requested this. I will try to find good articles that explain what we did and that answer questions you ask during the sessions. Things to pounder on and articles that give more background to what you're learning. I will add them in a themathical list with topics.

## objects

- [object basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)
- [a lot of excercises on class, objects inheritance and a number of patterns](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html) sidenote...they still need some translation work to javascript. Guess what I'll be doing over the next week or so. ðŸŽ‰
