# my secret stash of excercises muhahah

## excercise inheritance

Create a Shape class with multiple classes that inherrit this class. Make it so that a user should enter a given shape cherrypicked out of a list of shapes implemented. Once he has p√Æcked the shape the correct questions should be asked as to be able to calculate the surface of that given shape. After everything is entered the result of the surface of the shape should be returned to the user.

### important

this excercise should be easy extensible by just adding one class derived of shape and adding it in the list of shapes the user can pick from and a switch statement possibly.
